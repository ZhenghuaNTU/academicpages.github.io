* I am currently a <b>Scientist</b> (<b>PhD advisor</b>) at [Institute for Infocomm Research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, and a <b>Part-time Lecture</b> at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx).

* I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) at 2011 and PhD's Degree from [Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) at 2017 under the supervision of Prof. [Yeng Chai Soh](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=EYCSOH). After graduation, I have been working at NTU as a Research Fellow under the supervision of IEEE Fellow, IFAC Fellow, Prof. [Lihua Xie](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=elhxie).

* My research interest is sensory data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, transfer learning and related applications.
